## What is this?

This package provides a (lint) message format.

## When should I use this?

In most cases,
you can use `file.message` from `VFile` itself,
but in some cases you might not have a file,
and still want to emit warnings or errors,
in which case this can be used directly.

## Install

This package is [ESM only][github-gist-esm].
In Node.js (version 16+),
install with [npm][npmjs-instal
