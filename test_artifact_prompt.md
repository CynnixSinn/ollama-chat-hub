# Test Artifact System

Use this prompt to test the artifact functionality:

"Create a simple HTML login page with modern styling. Include a form with username and password fields, a login button, and some basic CSS styling to make it look professional."

The model should respond with an artifact containing the HTML code that can be previewed in the artifact panel.

## Expected Behavior:

1. Model creates an artifact with HTML content
2. Artifact appears in the artifacts panel on the right
3. Artifact panel shows both "Code" and "Preview" tabs
4. Preview tab shows the rendered HTML page
5. Code tab shows the syntax-highlighted HTML source
6. Chat message shows a reference to the artifact instead of the full code

## Alternative Test Prompts:

- "Create a React component for a todo list"
- "Build a CSS animation for a loading spinner"
- "Write a Python script that processes CSV files"
- "Create a JavaScript function that validates email addresses"
